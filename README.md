This is the luna modeler. It is able to simulate a rocket and its properties through time at is moves through a desired flight path. The model is intended to simulate the luna lander, an entry in the NASA Break The Ice competition. Below are properties as a result of simulations of a craft initialized with certain velocity vectors, and is stable in low earth orbit.
